This is a holiday-themed application designed to modernize Santaâ€™s age-old tradition of categorizing children into Naughty or Nice lists. This project uses user-generated behavior data to evaluate and classify kids based on predefined criteria.
    Users can interact with the system by submitting behavior data, reviewing personalized feedback, and even appealing their status
